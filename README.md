# Python Parables

Learning exercises to accompany and expand upon the [Google python Tutorials](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings).

## How to Guide


### 1. How to answer questions:

Each question is a class with a `test` method.  The test method should return the classes attribute `answer`.  You are only to change the code in the place that say `"YOUR CODE HERE"`.

### 2. How to check your answers:

Answers can be checked by running `python check_answers.py`.  If a question is incorrect you will see the incorrect answer next to the right answer or a traceback of an exception.
